				<h1>Tips to help you study better</h1>
				<p>Many people find it diffucult to study, here's some helpful tips that might help you be more effective at staying focused.<br>&nbsp;</p>
				<h2>1. Limit your distraction</h2>
				<p>Your study environment plays an important role in how well you stay focused. By limiting the number of distractions in your environment you can significantly improve your focus. So why not grab a headphone, play one of our sounds and get studying!<br>&nbsp;</p>
				<h2>2. Make a list</h2>
				<p>It can get overwhelming when there's a lot of content to get through. A good way to make studying more manageable is to make a list of things you want to achieve/cover. That makes things feel more manageable and help focus on the really important tasks.<br>&nbsp;</p>
				<h2>3. Take regular breaks</h2>
				<p>We can only study so long without our brain turning to mush. It's really important to take regular short breaks while studying so your brain can retain more information.<br>&nbsp;</p>
